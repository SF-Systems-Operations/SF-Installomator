# NOTE: adjust these variables:

# set to 0 for production, 1 or 2 for debugging
# while debugging, items will be downloaded to the parent directory of this script
# also no actual installation will be performed
# debug mode 1 will download to the directory the script is run in, but will not check the version
# debug mode 2 will download to the temp directory, check for blocking processes, check the version, but will not install anything or remove the current version
DEBUG=0

# notify behavior
NOTIFY=success
# options:
#   - success      notify the user on success
#   - silent       no notifications
#   - all          all notifications (great for Self Service installation)

# time in seconds to wait for a prompt to be answered before exiting the script
PROMPT_TIMEOUT=300
# Common times translated into seconds
# 60    =  1 minute
# 300   =  5 minutes
# 600   = 10 minutes
# 3600  =  1 hour
# 86400 = 24 hours (default)

# behavior when blocking processes are found
# BLOCKING_PROCESS_ACTION is ignored if app label uses updateTool
BLOCKING_PROCESS_ACTION=prompt_user
# options:
#   - ignore       continue even when blocking processes are found
#   - quit         app will be told to quit nicely if running
#   - quit_kill    told to quit twice, then it will be killed
#                  Could be great for service apps if they do not respawn
#   - silent_fail  exit script without prompt or installation
#   - prompt_user  show a user dialog for each blocking process found,
#                  user can choose "Quit and Update" or "Not Now".
#                  When "Quit and Update" is chosen, blocking process
#                  will be told to quit. Installomator will wait 30 seconds
#                  before checking again in case Save dialogs etc are being responded to.
#                  Installomator will abort if quitting after three tries does not succeed.
#                  "Not Now" will exit Installomator.
#   - prompt_user_then_kill
#                  show a user dialog for each blocking process found,
#                  user can choose "Quit and Update" or "Not Now".
#                  When "Quit and Update" is chosen, blocking process
#                  will be terminated. Installomator will abort if terminating
#                  after two tries does not succeed. "Not Now" will exit Installomator.
#   - prompt_user_loop
#                  Like prompt-user, but clicking "Not Now", will just wait an hour,
#                  and then it will ask again.
#                  WARNING! It might block the MDM agent on the machine, as
#                  the script will not exit, it will pause until the hour has passed,
#                  possibly blocking for other management actions in this time.
#   - tell_user    User will be showed a notification about the important update,
#                  but user is only allowed to Quit and Continue, and then we
#                  ask the app to quit. This is default.
#   - tell_user_then_kill
#                  User will be showed a notification about the important update,
#                  but user is only allowed to Quit and Continue. If the quitting fails,
#                  the blocking processes will be terminated.
#   - kill         kill process without prompting or giving the user a chance to save


# logo-icon used in dialog boxes if app is blocking
LOGO=appstore
# options:
#   - appstore      Icon is Apple App Store (default)
#   - jamf          JAMF Pro
#   - mosyleb       Mosyle Business
#   - mosylem       Mosyle Manager (Education)
#   - addigy        Addigy
#   - microsoft     Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune)
#   - ws1           Workspace ONE (AirWatch)
#   - filewave      FileWave
#   - kandji        Kandji
# path can also be set in the command call, and if file exists, it will be used.
# Like 'LOGO="/System/Applications/App\ Store.app/Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns"'
# (spaces have to be escaped).


# App Store apps handling
IGNORE_APP_STORE_APPS=no
# options:
#  - no            If the installed app is from App Store (which include VPP installed apps)
#                  it will not be touched, no matter its version (default)
#  - yes           Replace App Store (and VPP) version of the app and handle future
#                  updates using Installomator, even if latest version.
#                  Shouldn’t give any problems for the user in most cases.
#                  Known bad example: Slack will lose all settings.

# Owner of copied apps
SYSTEMOWNER=0
# options:
#  - 0             Current user will be owner of copied apps, just like if they
#                  installed it themselves (default).
#  - 1             root:wheel will be set on the copied app.
#                  Useful for shared machines.

# install behavior
INSTALL=""
# options:
#  -               When not set, the software will only be installed
#                  if it is newer/different in version
#  - force         Install even if it’s the same version


# Re-opening of closed app
REOPEN="yes"
# options:
#  - yes           App will be reopened if it was closed
#  - no            App not reopened

# Only let Installomator return the name of the label
# RETURN_LABEL_NAME=0
# options:
#   - 1      Installomator will return the name of the label and exit, so last line of
#            output will be that name. When Installomator is locally installed and we
#            use DEPNotify, then DEPNotify can present a more nice name to the user,
#            instead of just the label name.


# Interrupt Do Not Disturb (DND) full screen apps
INTERRUPT_DND="yes"
# options:
#  - yes           Script will run without checking for DND full screen apps.
#  - no            Script will exit when an active DND full screen app is detected.

# Comma separated list of app names to ignore when evaluating DND
IGNORE_DND_APPS=""
# example that will ignore browsers when evaluating DND:
# IGNORE_DND_APPS="firefox,Google Chrome,Safari,Microsoft Edge,Opera,Amphetamine,caffeinate"


# Use proxy for network access
PROXY=""
# Use this format for proxy: server.network.dns:port
# Configure proxy settings so that curl can work through that if needed.
# Port number is important for the check of access.
# Please note that some proxy configurations allow text download, but block binary downloads.
# So could be a situation where curl works for version, but not for download.
# This error line is then shown: “curl output was: curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 403”


# Swift Dialog integration

# These variables will allow Installomator to communicate progress with Swift Dialog
# https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog

# This requires Swift Dialog 2.11.2 or higher.

DIALOG_CMD_FILE=""
# When this variable is set, Installomator will write Swift Dialog commands to this path.
# Installomator will not launch Swift Dialog. The process calling Installomator will have
# launch and configure Swift Dialog to listen to this file.
# See `MDM/swiftdialog_example.sh` for an example.

DIALOG_LIST_ITEM_NAME=""
# When this variable is set, progress for downloads and installs will be sent to this
# listitem.
# When the variable is unset, progress will be sent to Swift Dialog's main progress bar.

NOTIFY_DIALOG=0
# If this variable is set to 1, then we will check for installed Swift Dialog v. 2 or later, and use that for notification


# NOTE: How labels work

# Each workflow label needs to be listed in the case statement below.
# for each label these variables can be set:
#
# - name: (required)
#   Name of the installed app.
#   This is used to derive many of the other variables.
#
# - type: (required)
#   The type of the installation. Possible values:
#     - dmg
#     - pkg
#     - zip
#     - tbz
#     - pkgInDmg
#     - pkgInZip
#     - appInDmgInZip
#     - pkgInDmgInZip
#     - updateronly     This last one is for labels that should only run an updateTool (see below)
#
# - packageID: (optional)
#   The package ID of a pkg
#   If given, will be used to find the version of installed software, instead of searching for an app.
#   Usefull if a pkg does not install an app.
#   See label installomator_st
#
# - downloadURL: (required)
#   URL to download the dmg.
#   Can be generated with a series of commands (see BBEdit for an example).
#
# - curlOptions: (array, optional)
#   Options to the curl command, needed for curl to be able to download the software.
#   Usually used for adding extra headers that some servers need in order to serve the file.
#   curlOptions=( -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/15.1 Safari/605.1.15" )
#   (See “mocha”-labels, for examples on labels, and buildLabel.sh for header-examples.)
#
# - appNewVersion: (optional)
#   Version of the downloaded software.
#   If given, it will be compared to the installed version, to see if the download is different.
#   It does not check for newer or not, only different.
#
# - versionKey: (optional)
#   How we get version number from app. Possible values:
#     - CFBundleShortVersionString
#     - CFBundleVersion
#   Not all software titles uses fields the same.
#   See Opera label.
#
# - appCustomVersion(){}: (optional function)
#   This function can be added to your label, if a specific custom
#   mechanism hs to be used for getting the installed version.
#   See labels zulujdk11, zulujdk13, zulujdk15
#
# - expectedTeamID: (required)
#   10-digit developer team ID.
#   Obtain the team ID by running:
#
#   - Applications (in dmgs or zips)
#     spctl -a -vv /Applications/BBEdit.app
#
#   - Pkgs
#     spctl -a -vv -t install ~/Downloads/desktoppr-0.2.pkg
#
#   The team ID is the ten-digit ID at the end of the line starting with 'origin='
#
# - archiveName: (optional)
#   The name of the downloaded file.
#   When not given the archiveName is derived from the $name.
#   Note: This has to be defined BEFORE calling downloadURLFromGit or
#   versionFromGit functions in the label.
#
# - appName: (optional)
#   File name of the app bundle in the dmg to verify and copy (include .app).
#   When not given, the appName is derived from the $name.
#
# - targetDir: (optional)
#   dmg or zip:
#     Applications will be copied to this directory.
#     Default value is '/Applications' for dmg and zip installations.
#   pkg:
#     targetDir is used as the install-location. Default is '/'.
#
# - blockingProcesses: (optional)
#   Array of process names that will block the installation or update.
#   If no blockingProcesses array is given the default will be:
#     blockingProcesses=( $name )
#   When a package contains multiple applications, _all_ should be listed, e.g:
#     blockingProcesses=( "Keynote" "Pages" "Numbers" )
#   When a workflow has no blocking processes, use
#     blockingProcesses=( NONE )
#
# - pkgName: (optional, only used for pkgInDmg, dmgInZip, and appInDmgInZip)
#   File name or path to the pkg/dmg file _inside_ the dmg or zip.
#   When not given the pkgName is derived from the $name
#
# - updateTool:
# - updateToolArguments:
#   When Installomator detects an existing installation of the application,
#   and the updateTool variable is set
#       $updateTool $updateArguments
#   Will be run instead of of downloading and installing a complete new version.
#   Use this when the updateTool does differential and optimized downloads.
#   e.g. msupdate on various Microsoft labels
#
# - updateToolRunAsCurrentUser:
#   When this variable is set (any value), $updateTool will be run as the current user.
#
# - CLIInstaller:
# - CLIArguments:
#   If the downloaded dmg is an installer that we can call using CLI, we can
#   use these two variables for what to call.
#   We need to define `name` for the installed app (to be version checked), as well as
#   `installerTool` for the installer app (if named differently than `name`. Installomator
#   will add the path to the folder/disk image with the binary, and it will be called like this:
#       $CLIInstaller $CLIArguments
#   For most installations `CLIInstaller` should contain the `installerTool` for the CLI call
#   (if it’s the same).
#   We can support a whole range of other software titles by implementing this.
#   See label adobecreativeclouddesktop
#
# - installerTool:
#   Introduced as part of `CLIInstaller`. If the installer in the DMG or ZIP is named
#   differently than the installed app, then this variable can be used to name the
#   installer that should be located after mounting/expanding the downloaded archive.
#   See label adobecreativeclouddesktop
#
### Logging
# Logging behavior
LOGGING="INFO"
# options:
#   - DEBUG     Everything is logged
#   - INFO      (default) normal logging level
#   - WARN      only warning
#   - ERROR     only errors
#   - REQ       ????

# MDM profile name
MDMProfileName=""
# options:
#   - MDM Profile               Addigy has this name on the profile
#   - Mosyle Corporation MDM    Mosyle uses this name on the profile
# From the LOGO variable we can know if Addigy og Mosyle is used, so if that variable
# is either of these, and this variable is empty, then we will auto detect this.

# Datadog logging used
datadogAPI=""
# Simply add your own API key for this in order to have logs sent to Datadog
# See more here: https://www.datadoghq.com/product/log-management/

# Log Date format used when parsing logs for debugging, this is the default used by
# install.log, override this in the case statements if you need something custom per
# application (See adobeillustrator).  Using stadard GNU Date formatting.
